# Factory Method

## Intent

> Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

## Code Sample

In this example we use the factory method to create different type of documents (Text Documents, Spreadsheet Documents). Each document type has it own factory implementation inheriting from the main Factory. The Factory creates the document, and it also handles saving the document.
