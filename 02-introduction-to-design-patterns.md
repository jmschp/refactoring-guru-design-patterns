# Introduction to Design Patterns

## What's a Design Pattern

A Design Pattern is a reusable solution to a common occurring problem in software design. It is a proven and well-documented approach that provides a template or blueprint for solving a particular design or architectural challenge.

### What does a pattern consist of?

1. Pattern Name: Each design pattern has a unique name that identifies and describes the problem it solves.
2. Problem: The problem describes the scenario or challenge that the design pattern addresses. It explains the context in which the pattern is applicable and the issues that the pattern aims to resolve.
3. Solution: The solution outlines the general steps, guidelines, and structure for solving the problem. It provides a reusable template that developers can adapt and apply to their specific implementation.
4. Consequences: The consequences describe the benefits, trade-offs, and implications of applying the design pattern. It includes considerations such as the impact on system flexibility, performance, complexity, and maintainability.

### Classification fo patterns

- Creational Patterns: These patterns focus on object creation mechanisms, providing flexible ways to create objects while hiding the creation logic. Examples include the Singleton, Factory Method, and Builder patterns.
- Structural Patterns: Structural patterns deal with the composition and relationships between classes and objects. They help define how objects are connected to form larger structures. Examples include the Adapter, Decorator, and Composite patterns.
- Behavioral Patterns: Behavioral patterns address the interactions and communication between objects. They define how objects collaborate and distribute responsibilities. Examples include the Observer, Strategy, and Template Method patterns.
- Architectural Patterns: Architectural patterns provide high-level solutions for organizing and structuring the overall architecture of a software system. Examples include the Model-View-Controller (MVC), Layered Architecture, and Microservices patterns.
