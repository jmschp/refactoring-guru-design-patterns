# Abstract Factory

## Intent

> Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern that lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

## Code Sample

In this example we use the Abstract Factory to build a database abstraction layer. Our products are different, but related, operation we can perform in a database. Each database management system is a product variant.

|            | **Product Connection** | **Product Query** |
| :--------: | :--------------------: | :---------------: |
| PostgreSQL | PostgreSQL Connection  | PostgreSQL Query  |
|   MySQL    |    MySQL Connection    |    MySQL Query    |
